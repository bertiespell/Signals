							I was inspired to build Signals after moving to a
							new city and finding it hard to connect with new
							people. It occurred to me that I pass the same
							people every day who share my interets and hobbies -
							we live in the same building, we go to the same gym,
							enjoy the same cafes or play the same sports. Yet
							there is very little infrastructure to discover one
							another. Despite an epidemic of loneliness, crowded
							cities and all of use carrying devices that
							constantly signal our location and availability to
							private companies... so often it seems harder than
							ever to connect with one another. Signals presents
							an opportunity to re-think social media, to put
							connection instead of content at the heart.
						</p>
						<p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
							I'm also very interested in DAOs as one of the most
							immediate and useful applications of blockchain for
							the average user, but much needs to be done to not
							just make them accessible to communities and people,
							but to educate on the potential posed by the
							technology. Since Signals allows users to connect
							over shared interests and places geographically, it
							already encourages the formation of communities and
							DAOs make it easier to organise in more advanced
							ways. it easily form communities with one another to
							organise their interests, in that vein, I see
							Signals as creating a dual opportunity for users:
							one to discover and connnect, and the other to
							organise and launch further DAOsl
						</p>
						<p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
							At this stage Signals is really just a proof of
							concept, but there are many things I'd like it to
							be, some of which are already implemented or alluded
							to here. Signals itself is organized as a DAO, so as
							users interact with the app they are rewarded in
							Signals Tokens. These tokens allow them to create
							and vote on proposals to modify the application,
							meaning that data and configuration is placed in the
							users hands. I'd really love to extend this idea to
							be a DAO launcher platform, where after connecting
							over shared spaces and interests, people can use the
							platform to manage their affairs. As an example,
							I've been part of shared rehersal spaces for
							musicians where the rent is paid together -
							organising people traditionally in this way was
							always difficult and not very transparent - I'd love
							Signals to become a way that people can not just
							discover these kinds of spaces but also to organise
							activities such as a subscription based model for
							community services like this.
						</p>
						<p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
							Since Signals is tied to geography and your
							location, it makes it ideal for several other
							purposes too - such as geographically based events.
							It is possible in the app to buy and sell tickets to
							events (which works similarly to an NFT). It's also
							possible to list local items and services, for sale
							which creates further potential for the economic
							viability of the project, but also just encouraging
							people to buy second-hand, the environmental
							benefits of which shouldn't be overlooked. Since
							everything happens on a map, it's really a limitless
							potential for opportunity and expansion - for
							example, you could drop a pin of your location on
							the map which calls to a specific ride sharing
							canister to look for available drivers.
						</p>
						<p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
							I'd love the opportunity to develop these ideas, and
							implement a production ready version of this idea.
							I've loved building on the ICP and have felt very
							inspired by the idea of building a completely
							decentralized app. Thanks so much for reading if you
							made it this far. I'm always very happy to hear
							feedback and of course - to make new connections -
							so feel free to reach out.
						</p>
						<p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
							Who am I? I'm a full stack developer, I've worked
							helping to build a 3D graphics library, a blockchain
							and most recently building backend and payment
							systems for millions of users at Sketch. I'm really
							passionate about trying to use blockchain to solve
							real world problems, and building beautiful products
							that really benefit people. I'm currently in the
							process of turning my ideas into something more
							concrete, I hope to find a path to be able to
							sustain myself building in this space... so, if you
							know of any, or want to link up, let me know. You
							can find me on any of the links below.
